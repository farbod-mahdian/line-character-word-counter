# line-character-word-counter

C/C++ Project

This program reads a text file and calculates the number of lines, characters, and words which the file has. Also, it shows how many unique words are there which are only used once as well as showing the top 10 words which are repeated more than others along; how many times that they were repeated will also be shown in the result.
